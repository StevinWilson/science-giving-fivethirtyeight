This is my preliminary analysis of the Federal Election Commission data on campaign funding during the period 2007-2016 filtered for the donor occupation. 

This occupation filtering was performed by Fivethirtyeight and the CSV file is available at https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/science-giving.

I have used R programming language and tidyverse& urbnmapr packages for data manipulation and visualisation.
